# Predicting-the-House-Price
A Machine Learning Model to Predict House Prices 

# **House Price Prediction**

This project aims to predict house prices using various features such as the number of rooms, area, location, and more, based on historical data. The model is built using Python and the linear regression algorithm.

## **Overview**
This project demonstrates the process of data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization to predict house prices.

## **Dataset**
- **Source**: The dataset is sourced from a reputable online repository, containing features that influence house prices such as the number of rooms, size, and location.
- **Description**: The dataset includes several variables that are commonly used to predict house prices.

## **Requirements**
- Python 3.7+
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab

Install the required libraries using:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib
```

## **Installation**
1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/house-price-prediction.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
   ```bash
   cd house-price-prediction
   ```
3. **Install the dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## **Usage**
1. **Open the Jupyter notebook**:
   - The project can be run by opening the `House_Price_Prediction.ipynb` notebook using Jupyter or Google Colab.
2. **Run the cells**:
   - The notebook is organized into sections. Run each section sequentially to preprocess data, train the model, and make predictions.

## **Results**
The linear regression model was trained on historical house data and achieved a 66.8% accuracy. The model can predict house prices based on the input features.

### **Sample Predictions**
- **Input**: Various input data representing house features.
- **Predicted Price**: Predicted price based on the trained model.
