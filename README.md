Usage
Open the Jupyter notebook:
The project can be run by opening the House_Price_Prediction.ipynb notebook using Jupyter or Google Colab.

Run the cells:
The notebook is organized into sections. Run each section sequentially to preprocess data, train the model, and make predictions.

Results
The linear regression model was trained on historical house data and achieved a 66.8% accuracy. The model can predict house prices based on the input features.

Sample Predictions
Input: Various input data representing house features.
Predicted Price: Predicted price based on the trained model.
